Grove Ranging sensor VL53L0X  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove-Ranging-sensor-VL53L0X.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove-Ranging-sensor-VL53L0X)
=======================================
  --Worldâ€™s smallest Time-of-Flight ranging and gesture detection sensor  
---------------------------------------------





Introduction:  
------------------------  
>The VL53L0X is a new generation Time-of-Flight(ToF) laser-ranging module housed in the smallest package on the market today,providing accurate distance measurement whatever the target reflectances unlike conventional technologies.  

***

Usage: 
========== 
>Download all the source files and open one of example,compile,upload,and running.Open the corresponding Serial Port to watch the result.  

Notice:
----------
>Not recommended for use under bright sun light. It will affects the accuracy of infrared.
>The range of measurement:10~2000mm(It is recommended to be within 1 meter in normal mode),further more,It has different performance when measure different color of object.Refer to doc/vl53l0x-datasheet.pdf to get more detail.
>This module supports:
>+ single ranging mode:Perform measurement once when calling the measurement function.
>+ continuous ranging mode:Perform measurement continuous with out interval time when calling the measurement function.
>+ high speed ranging mode : Reduce measurement time.
>+ high accuracy mode :Higher accuracy.but it will costs much more time.
>+ long distance mode :Longer measurement distance.
